### Getting Started with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ¿What will you find here?

A little project to apply some react concepts and fatures, just for practice and why not? to help someone to understand the react basic concepts, but what concepts?, there I go... 

1. Function component declaration 
2. One of the lifecycle methods of react with Hooks [useEffect] (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)
2. Adding some style based on .css file or why not? since .scss file with the css preprocessor SASS and some of their features (some, cuz they have a lot of features). 
3. I´ll try to apply responsive design, using [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and their feautures   
4. Fetching data with [Axios] (https://github.com/axios/axios), a strong HTTP client.  

## I Know, it´s a little but clean example and I´m really sure that this gonna be ok for someone
